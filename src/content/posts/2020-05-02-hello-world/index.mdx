# h1 Heading

First MDX Post for Gatsby Blog! Hello World!

But if I add some text around it, which is likely [Google](https://google.com) to be how I used it. It'll probably look fine because the entire paragraph is under grid.

## h2 Heading

`this is a bunch of single-line code`

### h3 Heading

```js:title=example-file.js
async getGfycatInfo(gfyname) {
  await this.checkToken();

  const res = await axios({
    method: "GET",
    url: `https://api.gfycat.com/v1/gfycats/${gfyname}`,
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${this.token}`,
    },
  });

  return res.data;
```
