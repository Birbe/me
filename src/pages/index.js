        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Ben, a second year Computer Science student at the University of York. I built
          this website to showcase the work I've been doing recently and to keep my skills web
          development skills warm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my studies, I usually spend my time programming, reading or playing in the
          University Jazz and Concert bands!
        </p>
        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently in the process of building a new website for myself, so this is kind of
          acting as a holding page for now.
        </p>
