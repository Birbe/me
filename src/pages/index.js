            Hi! I'm Ben, a third year Computer Science student at the University of York. I built
            this website to showcase the work I've been doing recently and to keep my skills web
            development skills warm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my studies, I usually spend my time programming, reading or playing in the
            University Jazz and Concert bands!
          </p>
          <h2>This Website</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently in the process of building a new website for myself, so this is kind of
            acting as a holding page for now.
          </p>
